Project Topic
• Topic: Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction
• Application Subject Area: Health and Medicine, specifically Cardiology.
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early prediction of heart
attacks crucial for preventive healthcare. This project will focus on heart attack analysis
and prediction using machine learning models in R. We will be using various algorithms
such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks in the
project along with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis to predict the risk of heart
attacks based on patient data. Key health indicators will be analyzed to identify patterns
and risk factors, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare
measures.

Specific Data Set and Sources: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
The “Heart Disease” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository includes medical
data related to heart disease diagnosis. It contains features such as age, sex, chest pain type,
resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic
results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression
induced by exercise), slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels
colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. This dataset is used to analyze and predict the
presence of heart disease, aiding in early diagnosis and effective treatment planning.
